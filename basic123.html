  <p>Answer the questions by scanning the text quickly.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTRUCTION:</strong><br>
  ‘Spot the Difference!’ This time, we will use Kahoot to make it more interactive and tech-friendly. I will group the class into two teams. Each team will select five representatives to answer first, but everyone will participate using their devices.<br><br>

  “Here’s how it works: I will show two similar-looking passages in each Kahoot question. Your task is to quickly scan the text and identify the difference. You’ll choose your answer on your device. The first team to answer correctly gets a point for their team.”<br><br>

  “Each question will appear for only five seconds, so you need to scan efficiently and stay focused. Don’t worry, even if you’re not a representative, your answers still count for your team’s total score!”</p>

  <p>You will examine your experience in using the scanning strategy by responding to the guide questions on Padlet. Through reflection and discussion, you will identify how scanning helped you locate specific information quickly and understand the difference between scanning and reading a text word for word. This will help you analyze the effectiveness of the strategy and its purpose in reading comprehension.</p>
  <p><strong>Questions to answer on Padlet:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>How did you use the scanning strategy in the Find the Key Info game?</li>
    <li>What helped you find the information quickly?</li>
    <li>What would happen if you read the entire passage instead of scanning?</li>

  <p><strong>Passage:</strong><br>
  The city’s public transportation system is undergoing a series of major improvements aimed at making commuting faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly. Starting next year, the city plans to replace all older diesel buses with electric buses on the main routes, which will significantly reduce air pollution and noise in urban areas. In addition, new bike lanes and pedestrian pathways are being constructed to encourage walking and cycling, promoting healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation. Smart traffic lights are being installed at major intersections to help ease congestion during rush hours, while real-time traffic monitoring systems will allow city officials to respond quickly to accidents or delays. The transportation department is also launching a mobile app that enables commuters to track bus locations, plan routes efficiently, and pay fares digitally without using cash. Community outreach programs will educate residents about the benefits of these changes, and feedback channels are being opened so commuters can share their experiences and suggestions. Officials hope that by implementing these improvements, daily commutes will become faster and more convenient, the city’s carbon footprint will be reduced, and the urban environment will become safer and more accessible for everyone, including people with disabilities and senior citizens.</p>

  <p>Instructions: You will practice the scanning strategy using a short online article. First, write the title and source of the article in the shared Google Doc. Then, scan the text to find specific details such as names, numbers, or dates, and highlight or underline them in the document. Finally, share the Google Doc link with me so I can check your work and see how well you applied the scanning strategy.</p>
